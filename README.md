# Nudgelyst

Pronounced nudge-a-list (rhyming with catalyst) or just simply nudge-list,
Nudgelyst aims to help with TODOs and Reminders from your daily life 
and make them accessible through a simple CLI. I realized how much
I wanted a basic task reminder and TODO system that I could access in
an interface I was commonly in and thus built Nudgelyst.

Nudgelyst got its name for being a catalyst for nudging the user about
tasks that need to be completed.

## Scratch Notes
- wanted to give abstracting the repo in which we save these todos to out
  - this did lead to some bit of awkwardness in the code that i would like to explore
